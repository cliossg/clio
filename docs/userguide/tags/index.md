# Tags

Tags categorize content with labels that work across sections. Click the **Tags** card on the [site dashboard](../sites/dashboard/index.md) to open the tags list.

## The Tags List

The list shows all tags for the current site. Each row displays:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **Name** | The tag name |
| **Slug** | The URL-friendly identifier, generated automatically from the name |
| **Actions** | Edit button |

---

## Creating a Tag

Click **New Tag** in the top-right corner. The form has a single field:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Name** | The display name for the tag (e.g. "JavaScript", "Travel") |

The slug is generated automatically from the name. Click **Create** to save the tag.

---

## Editing a Tag

Click **Edit** next to a tag in the list. You can update the tag name. The slug is regenerated from the new name.

Click **Update** to save changes or **Cancel** to discard.

## Using Tags

Tags are assigned to content items from the [content editor](../content/index.md). Unlike sections, which place content in a single group, tags allow cross-cutting categorization. A blog post can belong to one section ("Blog") but carry multiple tags ("JavaScript", "Tutorial", "Beginner").

## Deleting a Tag

Click **Delete** next to a tag in the list. Removing a tag unlinks it from any content that uses it. The content itself is not affected.
